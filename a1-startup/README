File Copier
This project consists of two versions of a file copying program: a single-threaded version (copier) and a multi-threaded version (mtcopier).

Requirements
C++ Compiler with C++20 support (e.g., GCC 9 or later)
Make


COMPILATION:
- Using Make
To compile the project, navigate to the project's root directory in the terminal and run:

make copier  # For the single-threaded version

OR

make mtcopier  # For the multi-threaded version




Running the Program
After compilation, you will see two executables: copier and mtcopier.

Single-Threaded Version
To run the single-threaded version, execute:

./copier <input_file> <output_file>
<input_file>: The address of the file you want to copy.
<output_file>: The destination file to which the contents will be copied.
Example:

make clean
